This thesis presents a recent literature review in software reuse and modern trends as introduced in the recent International 
Conference on Software Reuse (ICSR) 2015 in Miami, Florida. 

Within the thesis a web application was implemented, main objects of which are  the analysis of PHP and Java projects and 
the ability of a user to upload online his/her own source code that is being automatically analyzed and specific metrics
